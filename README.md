# Oboe-testing

This repository contains experimental evaluation of the Oboe system. To run all the code, put the directory of this repository at the same level as the `oboe` directory that contains the Oboe system.

Execution of code in `dataset_preprocessing` is required for `5.1.2 comparison_with_autosklearn` but not the others.
